# 1Password Opvault

Utility for exporting data from 1Password's encrypted opvault format. 1Password version 8 removed the ability to use locally-stored password vaults with their move to cloud-only storage.

## Usage

```
1password-opvault --help
```
```
Usage: 1password-opvault <command>

Flags:
  -h, --help    Show context-sensitive help.

Commands:
  export <path>
    Export 1Password opvault.

  version
    Show version.

Run "main <command> --help" for more information on a command.
```

Example usage with password prompt:

```
1password-opvault export /path/to/1Password.opvault/ --hide-passwords
```

Example line of output:

```
{"ainfo":"test@example.com","category":"Login","fields":[{"designation":"username","name":"login[username]","type":"T","value":"test@example.com"},{"designation":"password","name":"login[password]","type":"P","value":"******"},{"designation":"","name":"login[remember]","type":"C","value":"âœ“"}],"tags":[],"title":"Example","trashed":false,"urls":["https://example.com"]}
```

Data is exported in the [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format, which has the advantage of being able to be piped to programs like `grep` for further processing. For example:

```
1password-opvault export /path/to/1Password.opvault/ --hide-passwords | grep -i "aws"
```

Omit the `--hide-passwords` flag to show decrypted passwords.

Set the `ONEPASSWORD_OPVAULT_PASSWORD` environment variable to bypass the password prompt in non-interactive environments.

## Install

1Password Opvault may be installed directly from the source repository on a system with Go 1.16 or higher, and may be done like so:

```
go install github.com/evantbyrne/1password-opvault@latest
```
